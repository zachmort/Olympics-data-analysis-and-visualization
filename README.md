<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The summer 2021 olympics has recently come to an end. It was a wild ride for all countries and participants involved. World records were being broke left and right in many different events! This inspired me to take a look into some past Olympics data to see what interesting insights I could find.

Questions I had going into this project:
- What country has the most gold medals?
- What is the average height for the different competitions?
- Who owns the most gold medals across all events?
- How many events have been added over time?
- and many more!
